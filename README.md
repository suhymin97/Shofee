## 3. Functions & Features (completed)
An e-commerce site will have the seller user account and buyer/customer user account, each go along with its functions and features.  

*In this project, we designed one account will act as both a customer and a seller.*

**a. User - Customer:**
- Create new account, Login, Logout.

- Review/Comment/Rate functions for products.
- Proper authentication application to handle the user accounts.
- More function on interacting with user account: forget password, edit info, upload avatar, etc...


## 5. Challenges in the project.
- Not enough time to work on more technology/stack

# III. Result and Conclusion
Overall, we complete making a web application that can work as an e-commerce site, though it just has very simple functions and features. All we want to do and already achieved is that be able to work and understand how to made a web application with some technology/stack that we interest while learning WAD course at the university.   

For the future work, it is surely that we will continue to work on and improve the project as we learn further.
